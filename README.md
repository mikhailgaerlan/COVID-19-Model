**COVID-19 Model**

An SIR model with a time-dependent, exponentially-decaying reproduction number.

This model is based off data from JHU CSSE at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

My model assumes full immunity after infection and continued shelter-in-place orders to drive down the reproduction number.

Assuming these conditions, peak cases will occur around May 15 with an approximated ~115K deaths by then.
